# Three Popular Terminal Emulators - iTerm2, Hyper, and ZOC:

Terminal Emulators are software applications that replicate the functions of physical hardware terminals used with early computer systems. They allow users to access and interact with another system, such as a remote server , as(Techopedia, 2024). Furthermore, Terminal emulators will enable a host computer to connect to another system by utilizing the CLI via protocols like Telnet and SSH. This allows users to run applications and transfer files between systems regardless of operating system (Techopedia, 2024). Telnet is a network protocol allowing users to remotely access a computer's virtual terminal and communicate using a command line interface. SSH (Secure Shell) and Telnet are both used to remotely access systems, but SSH is more secure and has replaced Telnet as the preferred method (Google Search AI, 2024). 

## iTerm2 Terminal Emulator
iTerm2 is a terminal emulator with various incredibly useful features for macOS users. One of the key features of iTerm2 is the split panes. Split Panes or multi-view windows allow users to divide their terminal into multiple panes, each displaying a different session. Another highlighted feature was the Hotkey Window, which enables users to call upon the terminal from any application with just a single keystroke. This feature doesn't seem important at first, but it ensures users can access the terminal whenever needed (iTerm2 Features, 2024). 

iTerm2 also offers developers a variety of features, such as Autocomplete, Paste History, Instant Replay, Triggers, Shell Integration, Captured Output, and color scheme/keyboard shorts customization. These features streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and make debugging and project management more efficient and intuitive. These tools allow developers to automate tasks, quickly retrieve information, and seamlessly navigate their terminal environment, making iTerm2 a valuable addition to the toolbelt of any modern developer (iTerm2 Features, 2024).

## Hyper Terminal Emulator
The Hyper terminal emulator uses web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Due to the emulator's use of these technologies, Hyper is very customizable. Hyper Terminal users can modify the terminal's functionality and appearance by installing different plugins and themes. The Hyper Terminals "Extensions and Plugins" systems allow users to install "hot-reload" plugins without restarting the terminal. This feature is most beneficial to web developers who want to adjust their terminal to work with familiar tools or to provide continuity so they can install the tools their teammates or subordinates are using (Hyper, 2024). 

Additionally, the Hyper terminal emulator is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux, making It accessible to a wide range of users. Further, the terminal's configuration is managed by a Javascript file, which allows users to edit the emulator's settings and key mappings more easily. The "Keymaps Customization" feature enables users to remap their command keys to their preferences (Hyper, 2024). 

## ZOC Terminal Emulator
The ZOC terminal emulator is software used primarily by system admins and managers. It offers features such as connecting to older legacy systems. For example, users of the ZOC terminal can offer support for mainframes because the software supports different terminal emulations, including Xterm, VT220, TN3270, and TN5250. The ability to connect to these older systems makes it an attractive tool for many large organizations that still have legacy systems in service today (Emtec, 2024). 

The ZOC emulator is a Secure Shell (SSH) client that excels at providing secure connections to remote computers. "SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell) is a network protocol that gives users—particularly systems administrators—a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network" (Gillis et al., 2024). ZOC is highly customizable, allowing users to modify critical settings, set up custom buttons, and automate actions based on specific triggers. Its robust security features, including industrial-strength encryption, make it ideal for managing sensitive data across networks. Overall, ZOC’s versatility, automation capabilities, and robust security features make it a reliable choice for professionals connecting to various systems and automating complex tasks (Emtec, 2024).
