# Command Line Interface Vs. Graphical User Interface

The Command Line Interface is a text-based input system. The Graphical user interface is not text-based only. 
They allow users to interact with an actual application, with button areas for text and often very clear directions. 
While GUIs are very convenient for simple tasks like creating a new folder, changing directories, or updating a file, 
it is not a feasible tool for doing many of the previously mentioned tasks in bulk or repetitively, nor is the GUI the 
most efficient tool for doing most tasks simple or not. That is why the CLI is essential to learn: the CLI can do 
everything from changing directories to updating text files and automating tasks that would be, at the very least, 
tedious, resource-heavy, and time-consuming if done through the GUI. GUIs are great for designing and leisure 
activities like gaming! However, the CLI has been used since the 1960s since the first advent of computers, 
because it has been proven to work for everyday and advanced tasks. So, the scope of its use is high, and its 
membership includes super users, programmers, and every other tech field that uses a computer. 
Why? Because it is efficient, robust, and resilient.
