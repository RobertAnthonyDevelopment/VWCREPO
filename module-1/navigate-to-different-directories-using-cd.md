# Navigate to different directories using cd

## Introduction
Basic directory navigation is an essential skill when working in the terminal. The “cd” command which stands for "change directory" allows you to move between directories and access files or programs in different locations on your system. This section covers the simplest forms of the cd command, explaining how to navigate directly to specific directories.

## Basic Usage:

### Find Specific Directory:
This command demonstrates how to navigate to a specific directory using the full (absolute) path, which is necessary when you're not sure where you are in the file system.
- cd /Users/robertclemons/Desktop/cdnavpractice/cdnavpracticesub

### List the Contents of the Directory:
After navigating to a directory, you can use ls to list the contents of that directory
and confirm you are in the right place.
- ls /Users/robertclemons/Desktop/cdnavpractice/cdnavpracticesub

## Advanced Options:

### Switch to the Previous Directory (cd -):
Switching between directories with cd - is useful when you're frequently moving between two working directories. For example, if you’re editing files in one directory and testing code in another, cd - saves time by toggling between the two without having to retype the full paths each time. This is a very useful feature that allows you to toggle between two directories.

- cd /Users/robertclemons/Desktop/cdnavpractice 

- cd -
