## TICKET # 3 List the advantages of using CLI over GUI - In Work

# 1.1
One of the main performance benefits of Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) is speed. CLIs allow users to perform tasks faster than graphical user interfaces (GUIs) because they allow users to interact directly with the computer's operating system by typing text-based commands into the terminal. Graphical User Interfaces require users to go through a multitude of steps in order to perform simple tasks like installing a program. CLIs allow you to enter a simple text command to install the same program. Similarly, they enable end users to navigate directories and list files, making it easy to output the results to a text file for future reference or processing (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).

Another benefit of CLIs is that they use less resources, such as memory and power, compared to GUIs. This is because they can interact directly with the computer system and do not have to load graphics and complicated processes to execute the desired function the end-user is requesting. This can be especially useful when working with limited servers or accessing remote machines and resources. For example, instead of using parallels to launch a VM desktop, you could utilize an SSH to save resources on your local machine or server (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).  

# 1.3
Scripting is arguably the greatest tool that CLIs offer users. Through shell scripting CLIs allow users to automate tasks at a rate faster than any gui. A shell script is a list of commands the user can write once and can employ whenever they need to in the future (Coursera, 2023). For instance, if you need to back up your files every day, you can write a script to do that automatically, saving you from having to do it manually each time . This kind of automation can make managing your system much more accessible, especially as you learn more about how the CLI works. In short, CLIs are fast, efficient, and powerful tools for performing tasks, using fewer resources, and automating repetitive jobs, making them a great option to explore as you begin your journey into computer systems (Coursera, 2023).
